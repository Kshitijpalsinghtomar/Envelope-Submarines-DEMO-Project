        <h2>Discover Our Journey</h2>
        <p>
            Founded in 2020, Envelope was born from a passion for marine exploration and a commitment to making underwater adventures accessible for families. 
            Our mission is to provide durable and affordable submarines that ensure safety and reliability for parents and their children. 
            We believe in the importance of family bonding through adventure, and our submarines are designed to facilitate that. 
            Our values center around quality, affordability, and customer satisfaction, with a dedicated team focused on delivering exceptional products that families can trust.
        </p>
    
        <h3>From Vision to Reality</h3>
        <p>
            Our journey started with a simple goal: <strong>to create a safe, enjoyable, and affordable way for families to explore the wonders of the ocean</strong>. 
            What began as a bold idea has now become a reality, thanks to years of dedication, innovation, and a strong commitment to quality.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Breaking Barriers in Underwater Exploration</h3>
        <p>
            Traditional submarines were often complex and expensive, limiting deep-sea exploration to professionals. 
            We wanted to change that. By combining cutting-edge technology with user-friendly designs, we created submarines 
            that allow families, adventurers, and marine enthusiasts to experience the ocean like never before.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Challenges and Milestones</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2020 - Envelope was founded with a mission to redefine underwater exploration.</li>
            <li>2022 - Our first prototype successfully completed deep-water testing.</li>
            <li>2024 - We launched our first consumer-ready model, making waves in the industry.</li>
            <li>2025 - Recognized as a leader in family-friendly submarines, expanding globally.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>
            As we continue to grow, our focus remains on <strong>innovation, sustainability, and accessibility</strong>. 
            We are constantly improving our designs, integrating new safety features, and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in marine exploration.
